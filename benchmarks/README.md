# 📊 StreamPay Protocol Benchmark: Cross-Chain Streaming Comparison

A public, reproducible, and verifiable performance benchmark comparing **StreamPay** (Stellar / Soroban) against **Sablier V2** (Ethereum / Arbitrum) and **Superfluid CFA** (Polygon / Arbitrum / Ethereum) across the four primary economic and architectural axes that govern payment streaming systems:

1. **Storage Bytes per Stream**: On-chain persistent footprint per stream instance.
2. **Cost per Second of Stream Life**: Ongoing state rent vs perpetual state storage vs buffer capital lockup.
3. **Claim Cost**: Receiver withdrawal invocation overhead (CPU instructions, gas units, and transaction fees).
4. **Cancel Cost**: Premature settlement, unaccrued deposit refunds, and contract teardown.

## ⚖️ 2. Cross-Chain Honesty & Normalization

A credible benchmark must acknowledge that **EVM gas units and Soroban CPU instructions cannot be compared 1:1**, because each chain operates under an fundamentally different resource allocation and metering philosophy.

### What is Comparable

1. **User-Experienced Economic Cost**: Real-world transaction and maintenance costs denominated in USD across typical market conditions (L1 gas vs L2 gas vs Stellar base/resource fees).
2. **Operational Frequency Sensitivity**: How total costs scale as stream frequency, duration, and claim cadences increase.
3. **Escrow Solvency & Capital Requirements**: Whether 100% principal is locked upfront (StreamPay, Sablier) versus relying on buffer deposits and liquidation sentinels (Superfluid).

### What is NOT Comparable

1. **EVM Gas vs Soroban Instructions**:
   - EVM gas is a synthetic aggregate metric bundling CPU execution, memory allocation, and permanent disk writes into a single scalar, heavily distorted by arbitrary 20,000-gas SSTORE cliffs.
   - Soroban meters each dimension orthogonally: CPU instructions (100M transaction limit), memory bytes, read/write ledger entries, and serialized read/write bytes are priced separately according to actual node hardware cost.
2. **State Rent vs Perpetual State Bloat**:
   - **Ethereum & EVM Chains**: Storage is perpetual. Once written via `SSTORE`, a storage slot remains in state indefinitely without paying ongoing rent. The protocol compensates by punishing creation with high gas costs (~80,000 gas for 4 new slots).
   - **Stellar / Soroban**: Employs **State Archival**. State is not free: every persistent ledger entry pays rent proportional to its size and duration in ledgers (1 ledger ~ 5 seconds). If rent is exhausted, state is archived. StreamPay automatically extends TTL by 500,000 ledgers (~29 days) on creation and on every touch (claims, top-ups, cancels), shielding users from archival risk while honoring the ledger's true operational cost.
3. **Discrete Linear Escrow vs Continuous Differential Flow**:
   - Sablier and StreamPay lock 100% of the stream's deposit upfront. Insolvency is mathematically impossible, but claims require explicit on-chain transactions.
   - Superfluid shifts balances continuously via a differential accumulator (`balanceOf(t) = static + flowRate * dt`). Receivers experience **zero-gas claims**, but senders must lock a 4-hour liquidation buffer deposit and are exposed to bot liquidation if their wallet balance is depleted.

## 🔬 3. Inline Measurement Methodology

### StreamPay (Soroban)
- **Measurement Tool**: Built-in Soroban SDK cost meter: `env.cost_estimate().budget().cpu_instruction_cost()` and `memory_bytes_cost()`.
- **Harness Source**: [`contracts/streaming-payments/examples/protocol_benchmark.rs`](../contracts/streaming-payments/examples/protocol_benchmark.rs)
- **Rent Rate Formula**:
  $$\text{Rent Stroops / Second} = \text{Entry Bytes} \times \text{Rate} \times \frac{1}{\text{Seconds per Ledger}}$$
  Where $\text{Entry Bytes} = 484\text{ B}$, $\text{Rate} = 0.01\text{ stroops/byte/ledger}$, and $\text{Seconds per Ledger} = 5.0\text{ s}$:
  $$\text{Rent} = 484 \times 0.01 \times 0.2 = 0.968\text{ stroops/second} = 0.0000000968\text{ XLM/second}$$
  Monthly cost (30 days): $0.968 \times 86{,}400 \times 30 = 2{,}509{,}056\text{ stroops} \approx 0.2509\text{ XLM} \approx \$0.0301\text{ USD}$.
