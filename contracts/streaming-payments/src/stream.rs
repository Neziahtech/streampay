//! Stream state, storage, and the checked accrual math.
//!
//! Accrual is linear over the stream window: a stream funded with `deposit`
//! between `start_time` and `end_time` streams `deposit * elapsed / duration`
//! tokens, floored to whole token units. All arithmetic is checked (`u128`
//! intermediate products) and returns [`StreamError::MathOverflow`] instead of
//! overflowing or panicking.
//!
//! A renegotiated rate does not change that: it appends a [`RateSegment`]
//! window that starts where the change was accepted and ends at the stream's
//! `end_time`. Accrual is then the sum of one floored pro-rata term per segment
//! ([`segment_accrual`]), and the segments partition `[start_time, end_time)`.
//! Nothing before a segment boundary is ever recomputed, so an accepted rate
//! change cannot retroactively move what the recipient already earned. With no
//! segments stored the sum degenerates to exactly the single-window formula
//! above — bit for bit — which is what
//! `test::empty_plan_matches_single_window_formula` proves by exhaustive
//! comparison.
