//! The one canonical scenario, shared by the fixture generator and the
//! upgrade-replay harness.
//!
//! Every call site is an explicit contract invocation and every ledger
//! time is an absolute constant, so the persisted footprint (stream ids
//! 1..=6, intent ids 1..=4, one instance, one of each policy record) is
//! fully deterministic. The only environment-dependent bytes are the
//! generated addresses, which appear inside blobs but never in filenames,
//! manifest kinds, or assertions.
//!
//! The footprint pins, in one deploy:
//! * `Stream` in all three statuses (Active, Cancelled, Depleted), with
//!   and without a protocol fee, and with a top-up bumping `deposit`.
//! * Both stream index kinds (two recipients, one sender) and the sender's
//!   intent index.
//! * `ScheduledIntent` in all four statuses.
//! * Treasury: charged and partially drained, `StreamFee` records present
//!   and absent (zero-fee streams).
//! * Governance: governor + pending nominee, policy admin after a
//!   completed handoff (with a cancelled handoff along the way), a removed
//!   asset, a live queued change, per-token and global stream policies, a
//!   frozen-then-unfrozen contract, a completed v1→v2 migration, and a
//!   pending upgrade proposal.
//! * One captured instance of every `#[contractevent]` the contract emits.
//!
//! The timeline is monotonic and every step respects the contract's own
//! validation rules (start times never in the past, `execute_after`/
//! `expires_at` windows, recipient-vs-sender cancellation, the migration
//! freeze requirement, upgrade timelocks), so a rule change that would make
//! this footprint unwritable fails the scenario instead of silently
//! reshaping the corpus.
