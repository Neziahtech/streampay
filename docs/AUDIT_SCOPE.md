## 1. Executive Summary & Auditor Orientation

This hand-in package provides external security auditors with everything required to begin an audit of the StreamPay smart contract protocol immediately and efficiently.

StreamPay is a high-assurance, continuous payment streaming engine implemented for the Stellar network's Soroban smart contract platform. It provides second-by-second linear release of deposited escrowed tokens from a sender to a designated recipient. Core use cases include automated payroll, continuous token vesting schedules, and pay-as-you-go subscriptions.

## 2. In-Scope Entrypoint Catalog

The audit scope comprises the core smart contract in [`contracts/streaming-payments/`](../contracts/streaming-payments/). All mutating entrypoints enforce explicit authentication (`require_auth`), follow strict Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) sequencing, manage persistent storage TTLs, and emit strongly typed contract events.

## 3. Assets Handled & Token Semantics

StreamPay supports fungible assets conforming to standard Stellar asset standards:

### 3.1 Supported Token Standards
1. **Stellar Asset Contract (SAC) Assets**:
   - Native XLM (accessed via the canonical built-in Native SAC token contract).
   - Classic Stellar issued assets (e.g., USDC, EURC) wrapped through their canonical Stellar Asset Contracts.
2. **SEP-41 Fungible Token Interface**:
   - Custom Soroban smart contract tokens implementing the standard SEP-41 token interface (`transfer`, `transfer_from`, `balance`).

### 3.2 Token Handling Invariants & Assumptions
- **Raw Unit Integer Accounting**: All deposits, accrued balances, and payouts are calculated in integer units (`i128`) of the asset's smallest denomination (e.g. stroops for XLM, 7-decimal integer units for USDC). Float conversions are prohibited.
- **1:1 Balance Conservation**: The contract assumes tokens transfer exactly 1:1 on both ingress (`transfer_from`) and egress (`transfer`).
- **Defensive Error Remapping**: Token transfers use fallible calls (`try_transfer` / `try_transfer_from`). If an external token call fails (due to insufficient balance, lacking allowance, revoked trustline, or custom failure), StreamPay catches and remaps the error to a contract-specific code (`DepositTransferFailed` #26, `TopUpTransferFailed` #27, `RecipientPayoutFailed` #28, `SenderRefundFailed` #29, `TreasuryPayoutFailed` #30). This prevents third-party token errors from masquerading as StreamPay error variants and guarantees complete transactional rollback.

---

## 4. Known Non-Goals & Explicit Out-of-Scope Items

To maximize audit efficiency, the following behaviors and components are explicitly defined as non-goals:

1. **Fee-on-Transfer & Rebasing Tokens**:
   - *Status*: **Unsupported by Design**.
   - Tokens that deduct a transfer tax or modify stored balances dynamically break the balance conservation equation $\text{Balance}_{\text{contract}} = \sum (\text{deposit} - \text{withdrawn})$. Senders must only use standard 1:1 SAC/SEP-41 tokens.
2. **Ledger-Level SAC Clawback Interception**:
   - *Status*: **Protocol Non-Goal**.
   - If an asset issuer configures `AUTH_CLAWBACK_ENABLED` on a Stellar classic asset, Stellar consensus permits the issuer to claw back funds directly from any escrow account. The smart contract cannot prevent or intercept native ledger-level clawbacks executed by authorized asset issuers.
3. **Retroactive Window Extension (`end_time` modification)**:
   - *Status*: **Rejected by Design**.
   - Mid-stream extension of `end_time` is deliberately omitted in v1.0. Dynamically moving the end date backward reduces the per-second accrual rate, creating a mechanism where senders could retroactively dilute earnings already expected by the recipient. Top-ups add tokens across the *original* duration window only.
4. **Off-Chain Infrastructure & Frontend Client**:
   - *Status*: **Out of Primary Audit Scope**.
   - The Next.js web application (`frontend/`) and indexer worker (`indexer/`) are non-custodial reference implementations and advisory clients. The cryptographic trust anchor resides strictly in the smart contract bytecode (`contracts/streaming-payments/`).
5. **Zero-Knowledge / Confidential Privacy**:
   - *Status*: **Non-Goal**.
   - Stream parameters (sender, recipient, token, deposit, timestamps) are stored in transparent persistent Soroban ledger entries (`DataKey::Stream(u64)`). Confidential streaming is not a v1.0 feature.
6. **Keeper Network Availability Guarantees**:
   - *Status*: **Decoupled Operational Responsibility**.
   - Scheduled intents provide an on-chain escrow and fee reward (`fee_budget`), but the contract cannot guarantee that third-party off-chain keepers remain online or submit execution transactions promptly.

## 5. Trust Assumptions & Adversarial Analysis

### 5.1 Who Can Cancel a Stream

Stream cancellation is governed by strict, immutable role permissions:

```text
cancel_stream(caller, stream_id)
      │
      ├── caller == stream.sender ───────────────────────▶ ALLOWED (Always)
      │
      ├── caller == stream.recipient AND cancelable ────▶ ALLOWED (Mutual consent)
      │
      ├── caller == stream.recipient AND !cancelable ───▶ REJECTED (CancelStreamNotCancellable #4)
      │
      └── caller != sender AND caller != recipient ─────▶ REJECTED (CancelStreamNotAuthorized #12)
```

1. **Sender Authority**: The sender can **always** cancel an active stream at any time. This protects senders in cases of terminated contracts, unfulfilled milestones, or subscription discontinuations.
2. **Recipient Authority**: The recipient can **only** cancel if the stream was explicitly initialized with `cancelable = true`. If `cancelable = false` (standard for irrevocable vesting schedules or guaranteed payroll), a cancellation attempt by the recipient reverts with `StreamError::CancelStreamNotCancellable` (code 4).
3. **Third-Party Griefing**: Any address other than the authenticated sender or recipient is rejected with `StreamError::CancelStreamNotAuthorized` (code 12).
4. **Lifecycle Guards**: A stream that is already `Cancelled` or `Depleted` cannot be cancelled again; attempts revert with `StreamError::StreamNotActive` (code 5).
5. **Pro-Rata Settlement Guarantee**:
   Upon valid cancellation:
   $$\text{streamed} = \left\lfloor \frac{\text{deposit} \times \text{elapsed}}{\text{duration}} \right\rfloor$$
   $$\text{payout}_{\text{recipient}} = \text{streamed} - \text{withdrawn}$$
   $$\text{refund}_{\text{sender}} = \text{deposit} - \text{streamed}$$
   Both token transfers are executed atomically after state transition to `StreamStatus::Cancelled` (CEI).

### 5.2 Cancel-vs-Withdraw Race Semantics

On Stellar/Soroban, transactions are executed sequentially within each ledger without interleaving. When a sender's cancellation transaction and a recipient's withdrawal transaction contend for the same stream within the same ledger or consecutive ledgers, execution order is deterministic:

```text
Case 1: withdraw(partial) executes before cancel_stream
  1. withdraw pays partial amount to recipient; updates s.withdrawn.
  2. cancel_stream executes next:
     - Splits the remainder: recipient receives (streamed - updated_withdrawn).
     - Sender receives (deposit - streamed).
  ==> Result: Full balance conserved. Recipient receives exactly accrued funds.

Case 2: withdraw_max drains stream to Depleted before cancel_stream
  1. withdraw_max pays all remaining accrued deposit to recipient; sets status = Depleted.
  2. cancel_stream executes next:
     - Reverts with StreamNotActive (code 5).
  ==> Result: Zero state change from cancel. Recipient holds deposit; sender refund is 0.

Case 3: cancel_stream executes before withdraw / withdraw_max
  1. cancel_stream sets status = Cancelled; executes pro-rata split payouts.
  2. withdraw / withdraw_max executes next:
     - Reverts with StreamNotActive (code 5).
  ==> Result: Zero state change from withdraw. Both parties hold their pro-rata split.
```

#### Invariants of the Race:
- **Last Write Wins**: The second transaction encounters the finalized state of the first transaction and either adapts cleanly (Case 1) or reverts as a clean no-op (Cases 2 & 3).
- **Exact Balance Conservation**: Across all race conditions, $\text{payout}_{\text{recipient}} + \text{refund}_{\text{sender}} = \text{deposit}$ holds byte-for-byte.
- **Loser is a Pure No-Op**: When a call reverts with `StreamNotActive` (code 5), no state is written, no tokens are moved, and no event is logged.

### 5.3 What a Malicious Recipient CAN and CANNOT Do

| Action Category | Specific Adversarial Behavior | Possibility | Protocol Defense / Security Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Accrual Sniping** | Monitor mempool for sender's `cancel_stream` and front-run with `withdraw_max` | **CAN** DO | **Acceptable economic behavior**: Recipient extracts only what has legitimately accrued up to that second. Cannot extract unaccrued deposit. |
| **Early Termination** | Cancel the stream before sender can cancel | **CAN** DO (Iff `cancelable`) | Recipient receives accrued tokens; sender receives unaccrued remainder immediately. If `cancelable == false`, contract rejects call with code 4. |
| **Transfer Denial** | Use a contract address that rejects transfers or revoke token trustlines | **CAN** DO | Payout fails with `RecipientPayoutFailed` (code 28), causing transaction rollback. Contract escrow remains secure; funds are not stolen. |
| **Fund Dormancy** | Leave accrued tokens unwithdrawn in escrow indefinitely | **CAN** DO | Escrow remains safe. Managed through persistent storage TTL extensions. |
| **Over-Withdrawal** | Call `withdraw(amount)` with $\text{amount} > \text{available}$ | **CANNOT** DO | Reverts with `InsufficientStreamBalance` (code 1). Checks enforce $\text{amount} \le \text{available}$. |
| **Pre-Accrual Claim** | Call `withdraw` before `start_time` | **CANNOT** DO | Available balance evaluates to 0; call reverts with `InsufficientStreamBalance` (code 1). |
| **Post-Termination Claim** | Call `withdraw` on `Cancelled` or `Depleted` stream | **CANNOT** DO | Reverts with `StreamNotActive` (code 5). |
| **Vesting Circumvention** | Cancel a stream when `cancelable == false` | **CANNOT** DO | Reverts with `CancelStreamNotCancellable` (code 4). |
| **Escrow Siphoning** | Drain tokens belonging to other streams or protocol fees | **CANNOT** DO | Monolithic storage per stream (`DataKey::Stream(id)`), mathematical isolation, and checked math prevent cross-stream leakage. |
| **Reentrancy Theft** | Re-enter contract during token transfer callback | **CANNOT** DO | Strict CEI pattern: state status and `withdrawn` are persisted before `token.transfer` executes. Reentrant call finds balance already subtracted. |
| **Parameter Mutation** | Alter deposit, duration, token, or sender | **CANNOT** DO | Stream parameters are immutable once stored in `Stream`. Only `withdrawn`, `deposit` (top-up), and `status` mutate. |

## 6. Reproducible-Build Verification Steps

Every production release of StreamPay produces a canonical Wasm binary whose SHA-256 digest is attested and cryptographically signed. External auditors can reproduce the compiled Wasm byte-for-byte using the pinned toolchain.

### 6.1 Pinned Toolchain Triad

| Component | Pinned Version | Source of Truth |
|---|---|---|
| **Rust Compiler (`rustc`)** | `1.99.1` | `rust-toolchain.toml` |
| **Target Architecture** | `wasm32v1-none` | `rust-toolchain.toml`, `contracts/streaming-payments/Cargo.toml` |
| **Stellar CLI** | `28.1.0` | `.github/workflows/ci.yml:79`, `docs/REPRODUCING.md` |

### 6.2 Step-by-Step Reproduction Instructions

#### Step 1: Clone Repository and Checkout Release Tag
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Neziahtech/streampay.git
cd streampay
git checkout v0.5.0 # Or specific release tag
```

#### Step 2: Install Pinned Toolchain
```bash
# Install pinned Rust toolchain with wasm target
rustup toolchain install 1.99.1 --target wasm32v1-none --profile minimal
rustup default 1.99.1

# Install pinned stellar-cli binary
cargo install stellar-cli --version 28.1.0 --locked
stellar --version # Must output: stellar 28.1.0
```

#### Step 3: Build Contract Wasm
```bash
cd contracts/streaming-payments
stellar contract build
cd ../..
```

#### Step 4: Verify SHA-256 Digest Against Release
Compute the SHA-256 hash of the compiled Wasm binary:
```bash
sha256sum target/wasm32v1-none/release/streampay_contract.wasm
```

Compare the digest against the published release digest in `release-metadata.json` or `SHA256SUMS`:
```bash
# Automated comparison using repo verification script
./scripts/verify_reproducible_build.sh --current "$EXPECTED_SHA256"
```

#### Step 5: Verify Signed Release Attestation
StreamPay signs all release hashes with Ed25519. To verify the cryptographic signature against the repository's pinned public key (`attestations/signing-key.pub`):
```bash
./scripts/verify_wasm.sh
```
